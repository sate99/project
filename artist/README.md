# Simple artist search APP using Spotify’s open APIs
The app has three screen:

1) The first screen is a search page where you can search for an artist by name. There

could be multiple artists that match the name, so make sure that you handle

pagination where the user can see the results page by page.

2) Once you have found the artist you were searching for, click on the “View Albums”

link will take you to an artist detail page where you will list (again, paginated) the

albums of the artist.

3) Clicking on the View Tracks of an album listing will open up a modal that shows the

album name, the release date and a list of tracks in the album and the duration of

each track.
